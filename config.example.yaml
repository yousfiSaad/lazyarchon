# Theme Selection:
# LazyArchon comes with 4 built-in themes that you can select using ui.theme.name:
# - "default": Modern dark theme with blue/cyan accents
# - "monokai": Inspired by Monokai color scheme (pink/green/cyan)
# - "gruvbox": Warm, retro-inspired colors (orange/green/yellow)
# - "dracula": Dark theme with purple/pink accents
#
# You can also override individual colors by uncommenting the color options above.
# Color overrides take precedence over the selected theme.
#
# Theme Usage Examples:
# ui:
#   theme:
#     name: "gruvbox"  # Use gruvbox theme with all its colors
#
# ui:
#   theme:
#     name: "monokai"       # Use monokai as base
#     header_color: "226"   # But override header to bright yellow
#
# Status symbols used in the interface:
# ○ Todo     - Empty circle (clear starting state)
# ◐ Doing    - Half-filled circle (work in progress)
# ◈ Review   - Diamond with center dot (under review)
# ✓ Done     - Checkmark (completed)
#
# Color Enhancement Features:
# feature_colors: When enabled, feature tags (#tag-name) get unique colors per feature
#   - Each feature gets a consistent color assigned via hash algorithm
#   - Works with all 4 themes - colors are theme-specific
#   - Helps quickly identify tasks belonging to the same feature area
#   - Feature modal checkboxes and names also use feature-specific colors for consistency
#
# feature_backgrounds: When enabled, entire task rows get subtle background tints
#   - Very subtle color hints based on the feature
#   - Only applies to non-selected tasks to avoid conflicts
#   - Provides additional visual grouping for related tasks
#
# priority_indicators: When enabled, shows priority symbols before task status
#   - ⬆ High priority (task_order >= 80) - red color
#   - ➡ Medium priority (task_order >= 50) - yellow color
#   - ⬇ Low priority (task_order < 50) - gray color
#   - Helps quickly identify important tasks that need attention
#
# status_color_scheme: Choose how task status colors are displayed
#   - "blue" (default): Vibrant, colorful scheme with high contrast
#     * Review: Purple/violet (highest attention)
#     * Doing: Amber/yellow (active work)
#     * Todo: Gray (neutral)
#     * Done: Green (completed)
#     * Best for: Users who prefer colorful, attention-grabbing interfaces
#
#   - "gray": Neutral, productivity-focused grayscale
#     * Review: Brightest gray (highest attention)
#     * Doing: Medium-light gray
#     * Todo: Medium-dark gray
#     * Done: Darkest gray (lowest attention)
#     * Best for: Reduced eye strain, professional environments, long coding sessions
#
#   - "warm_gray": Gentle grayscale with warm undertones
#     * Same hierarchy as gray, but with subtle warm (yellowish) tones
#     * Best for: Comfortable for extended use, less fatiguing than pure gray
#
#   - "cool_gray": Modern grayscale with cool undertones
#     * Same hierarchy as gray, but with subtle cool (bluish) tones
#     * Best for: Modern, professional appearance, clean aesthetic
#
# All color schemes maintain the same visual hierarchy:
#   Review (highest attention) > Doing > Todo > Done (lowest attention)
#
# Smart Layout Features:
# - Adaptive text width calculation accounts for all visual indicators
# - Intelligent truncation preserves priority symbols and feature tags when possible
# - Feature tags are automatically hidden in narrow terminals to preserve title visibility
# - Uses visual width measurements instead of string length for accurate sizing
