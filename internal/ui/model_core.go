// model_core.go now serves as a placeholder file for future core model functionality.
// All previous functions have been moved to focused modules:
//
// - model_core_init.go:     Model initialization and dependency injection
// - model_core_data.go:     Basic data getters and interface implementations
// - model_core_layout.go:   Layout calculations and sizing
// - model_core_search.go:   Search functionality for tasks and features
// - model_core_features.go: Feature management and filtering
// - model_core_sorting.go:  Task sorting and filtering logic
//
// This modular structure improves maintainability and follows the Single Responsibility Principle.
